# CognitiveServices-Python
A collection of samples and facilitator methods to access Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs

This can be used an SDK for Microsoft Cognitive Services but it is **not official** and offers no garantees.

Currently provides a Python SDK that completely implements the following APIs:
- Translator Text API
- Computer Vision API

Each API 'SDK' file is inside the corresponding folder and a Jupyter notebook is provided to demonstrate the usage of the SDK and also showcase the functionality of the Cognitive Services REST APIs.

You can open the Jupyter notebooks directly on GitHub to see the results of running the code.
To actually run the code yourself, you need to sign up and get the API keys here:
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/

Note, some of the APIs are available in a "try-only" experience in case you prefer a simpler approach:

Enjoy!

Any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out!
